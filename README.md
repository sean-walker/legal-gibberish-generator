# Legal Gibberish Generator
Final project for Yale's CPSC 185: Control, Privacy, and Technology, spring '17.

The results didn't end up very coherent, which I suppose is to be expected given that I'm using a bigram (i.e. not very good) language model.
That being said, it still definitely reads _a bit_ like you would expect legalese to be, and I'm happy with that.
I think the corpus could also be improved upon; the one I used was "Supreme Court Conversations," i.e. not actual decisions.
I did find a corpus of decisions (http://corpus.byu.edu/scotus/), but it is not available to download :(
